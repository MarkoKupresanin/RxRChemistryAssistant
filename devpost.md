## Inspiration
My inspiration for the name of this project was because my Chemistry teacher taught us to balance Chemical Equations with the "Railroad Method". 

## What it does
This web app can balance a Synthesis Chemical Reaction and display information about elements of the periodic table and polyatomic ions.

## How I built it
I built it using Python's Flask library and stored the Periodic Table and Polyatomic Ion data in json files. 

## Challenges I ran into
I ran into challenges with hosting on Heroku as one does, as well as some general Python bugs that I tried to troubleshoot.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud that I took up the challenge to go to a hackathon solo and I learned a lot about how I should manage my project in a short time (despite not being fully finished)

## What I learned
I learned that the project choice was a bit ambitious to create in 24 hours, but nevertheless gained a lot of experience with how Flask was able to work in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

## What's next for RxR Chemistry Assistant
I plan on taking more time after Gunnhacks to grow this project to be able to balance Single Replacement, Double Replacement, and Combustion Reactions. Possibly even a Stoichiometry converter as well.
